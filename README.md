Project Overview:-
Welcome! This project demonstrates my ability to set up and manage a Kubernetes environment using Minikube. The core objective here was to deploy an Nginx web server in a Kubernetes cluster, simulating real-world cloud deployments without relying on commercial cloud providers like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

Why This Project?
I created this project to:
Practice Kubernetes orchestration skills.
Deploy and manage containerized applications (Nginx in this case) without needing access to cloud services, demonstrating my adaptability in diverse environments.
Showcase my cloud engineering capabilities, particularly in working with CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, and containerization.

Tools required:-
Kubernetes: The core orchestration platform used to manage the Nginx deployment.
Minikube: A local Kubernetes platform for running Kubernetes clusters on your local machine.
Docker: Containerization of the Nginx web server.
Nginx: A lightweight, fast web server to serve content and demonstrate service orchestration.

Key Features:-
Nginx Deployment in Kubernetes: I’ve deployed an Nginx web server as two replicated pods, showcasing horizontal scaling in Kubernetes.
NodePort Exposure: The Nginx server is accessible via a NodePort, simulating how applications are exposed to the outside world.
Hands-on Kubernetes Management: From using kubectl commands for deployment to managing pods and services, this project reflects my experience in Kubernetes.

Challanges and Learnings:-
One challenge I encountered was optimizing the resource usage on my local machine while running Minikube and Docker simultaneously. This taught me valuable lessons about resource management and how cloud platforms handle load balancing and scaling more efficiently in production environments.
I also deepened my understanding of Kubernetes services and networking—specifically, how NodePorts work and how external traffic is routed to internal services within the cluster. These concepts are key in cloud-native applications, where containers are the foundation of microservices.

Conclusion:-
By creating this project, I’ve demonstrated my ability to work with the essential tools and techniques required for cloud and DevOps roles. I’m excited to continue building on these foundations, and this project is a stepping stone in my journey to mastering cloud-native infrastructure.
